# Monthly Interest Calculation Update

## 🎯 **What Was Changed**

### **Problem**
- Monthly payment frequency loans were showing daily accumulated interest
- Interest was calculated daily regardless of payment frequency
- This was confusing for monthly payment loans

### **Solution**
- Modified `calculate_accumulated_interest()` function in `app_multi.py`
- Added logic to handle monthly vs daily payment frequency differently
- Updated interest calculation modals in both admin and customer views

## 📊 **New Monthly Interest Logic**

### **Before 30 Days**
- **Accumulated Interest**: ₹0.00
- **Reason**: No interest shown until 30 days have passed
- **Display**: "Interest will be calculated at month end"

### **After 30 Days**
- **Calculation**: Monthly Interest × Complete Months
- **Monthly Interest**: Principal × (Annual Rate ÷ 12)
- **Complete Months**: Days since creation ÷ 30
- **Example**: 60 days = 2 complete months

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Code Changes**
1. **`app_multi.py`** - Updated `calculate_accumulated_interest()` function
2. **`templates/admin/view_loan.html`** - Updated interest calculation modal
3. **`templates/customer/loan_detail.html`** - Updated interest calculation modal

### **Key Logic**
```python
if loan.payment_frequency == 'monthly':
    if days_since_creation < 30:
        return Decimal('0')  # No interest before 30 days
    else:
        months_passed = days_since_creation // 30
        monthly_interest = calculate_monthly_interest(loan.principal_amount, loan.interest_rate)
        return monthly_interest * months_passed - verified_payments
```

## 📈 **Examples**

### **Monthly Loan (12% Annual Rate, ₹1,00,000 Principal)**
- **15 days**: ₹0.00 (before 30 days)
- **30 days**: ₹1,000.00 (1 complete month)
- **45 days**: ₹1,000.00 (1 complete month)
- **60 days**: ₹2,000.00 (2 complete months)
- **90 days**: ₹3,000.00 (3 complete months)

### **Daily Loan (12% Annual Rate, ₹1,00,000 Principal)**
- **15 days**: ₹500.00 (daily calculation)
- **30 days**: ₹1,000.00 (daily calculation)
- **45 days**: ₹1,500.00 (daily calculation)
- **60 days**: ₹2,000.00 (daily calculation)
- **90 days**: ₹3,000.00 (daily calculation)
