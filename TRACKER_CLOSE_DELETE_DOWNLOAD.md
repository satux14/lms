## Database Changes

### New Column: `is_closed_by_user`

```sql
ALTER TABLE daily_tracker 
ADD COLUMN is_closed_by_user BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0;
```

**Values:**
- `False` (0) - Tracker is active for user (default)
- `True` (1) - User has closed/hidden it

**Query Logic:**

**For Users (show only active, not closed):**
```python
tracker = get_daily_tracker_query().filter_by(
    user_id=current_user.id,
    is_active=True,
    is_closed_by_user=False
).first()
```

**For Admin (show all active trackers, including closed):**
```python
trackers = get_daily_tracker_query().filter_by(
    is_active=True  # Only check is_active, not is_closed_by_user
).all()
```

---

## Migration

### For New Installations

Run the complete migration:
```bash
python3 migrate_daily_tracker.py
```

The `is_closed_by_user` column will be included automatically.

### For Existing Installations

Run the additional migration:
```bash
python3 migrate_tracker_features.py
```

This adds the `is_closed_by_user` column to existing tables.

**What it does:**
- Adds `is_closed_by_user` column
