Shows the actual loan calculations including all verified payments.

**Columns:**
- **Day**: Day number (1-180)
- **Date**: Calendar date
- **Opening Principal**: Principal amount at start of day
- **Daily Interest**: Interest accrued for that day
- **Accumulated Interest**: Total interest accumulated from loan start
- **Payment Amount**: Total payment made on that day

- ✅ All amounts formatted as currency (₹)
- ✅ Shows how each payment reduces interest and principal

### **Sheet 2: Without Payments (Projection)**
Shows what the loan would look like with NO payments made.

**Columns:**
- **Day**: Day number (1-180)
- **Date**: Calendar date
- **Opening Principal**: Principal amount (never changes)
- **Daily Interest**: Interest accrued for that day
- **Accumulated Interest**: Total interest accumulated from loan start
- **Closing Principal**: Principal amount (same as opening)
- **Remaining Interest**: Same as accumulated interest

**Purpose:**
- 📝 Manual verification and calculation checks
- 📝 Compare "what if" scenarios
- 📝 Fill in your own calculations to verify system accuracy

## 🧮 **Calculation Method**

### **Interest Calculation**
- **Daily Rate** = Annual Rate ÷ 360 days ÷ 100
- **Daily Interest** = Opening Principal × Daily Rate
- **Accumulated Interest** = Sum of all daily interest minus interest paid

### **Payment Allocation (Regular Loans)**
1. **First**: Pay accumulated interest
2. **Then**: Remainder goes to principal
3. Principal only reduces after accumulated interest is paid

### **Example**
Loan: ₹200,000 @ 21% annual
- Day 43: Accumulated interest = ₹5,016.67
- Payment: ₹5,000
- **Allocation**: ₹5,000 to interest, ₹0 to principal
- Remaining interest: ₹16.67
