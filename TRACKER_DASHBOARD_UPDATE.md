# Tracker Dashboard & Admin Close Feature

## Overview

Two major improvements to the daily tracker system:
1. **Admin can now close trackers** (not just delete)
2. **New intermediate tracker dashboard** for users with summary and table view

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Admin Close Tracker Feature

**Problem:** Admin could only delete or reopen trackers, not close them.

**Solution:** Added close button for admins to hide tracker from user view.

#### New Admin Route

```python
@app.route('/<instance>/admin/daily-trackers/<tracker_id>/close', methods=['POST'])
def admin_close_tracker(instance_name, tracker_id):
    # Sets is_closed_by_user = True
    # User won't see it, but admin can still manage it
```

#### Admin UI Updates

**Admin Tracker List - Action Buttons:**
- 👁️ View
- ✏️ Edit
- ⬇️ Download
- **⭕ Close** (NEW - gray button when tracker is active)
- **📂 Reopen** (orange button when tracker is closed)
- 🗑️ Delete

**Button Logic:**
- If tracker is **Active** → Show Close button (gray)
- If tracker is **Closed by User** → Show Reopen button (orange)

---

### 2. ✅ Intermediate Tracker Dashboard

**Problem:** With 20+ trackers, main dashboard gets cluttered.

**Solution:** Created dedicated tracker dashboard page with summary tiles and table view.

#### New User Route

```
/<instance>/customer/trackers-dashboard
```

#### Dashboard Features

**Summary Tiles (Top):**
1. **Total Pending Amount** - Sum of pending across all trackers
2. **Active Trackers** - Count of active trackers
3. **Total Payments** - Sum of all payments made

**Trackers Table:**
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Tracker Name | Name + scheme period |
| Investment | Initial investment amount |
| Start Date | When tracker started |
| Days Paid | Number of days with payments |
| **Last Paid Date** | Most recent payment date ⭐ |
| Total Payments | Sum of all payments |
| **Pending** | Outstanding amount ⭐ |
| Balance | Current balance (if applicable) |
| Actions | View button |

**Table Footer:**
- Shows totals for Payments and Pending columns

### 3. ✅ Updated Main Dashboard

**Before:**
```
[Tracker 1 Card]  [Tracker 2 Card]
[Tracker 3 Card]  [Tracker 4 Card]
...
```

**After:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📅 Investment Trackers                          │
│ Active Trackers: 20                             │
│ Click to view details and track your investments│
│                      [View All Trackers] ───────┤
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Single card** that links to the intermediate dashboard page.

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario: User with 20+ Trackers

**Step 1: Main Dashboard**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Investment Trackers                     │
│ Active Trackers: 25                     │
│              [View All Trackers] ──────►│
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Step 2: Trackers Dashboard**
```
┌──────────────────┐ ┌──────────────────┐ ┌──────────────────┐
│ ₹15,240.50      │ │ 25               │ │ ₹1,234,567.89   │
│ Total Pending    │ │ Active Trackers  │ │ Total Payments   │
└──────────────────┘ └──────────────────┘ └──────────────────┘

╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ Tracker Name  │ Last Paid │ Pending  │ Actions            ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ Q4 Investment │ 15 Oct 24 │ ₹1,250   │ [View]             ║
║ Q1 Investment │ 10 Oct 24 │ ₹2,500   │ [View]             ║
║ ...           │ ...       │ ...      │ ...                ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**Step 3: Individual Tracker**
```
Click [View] → Opens specific tracker with all daily entries
```

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Calculations

#### Last Paid Date
```python
# Find most recent date with payment
for row in reversed(tracker_data['data']):
    if row.get('daily_payments'):
        last_paid_date = row.get('date')
        break
```

#### Pending Amount
```python
# Expected vs Actual
expected = days_with_payments * per_day_payment
actual = total_payments
pending = expected - actual
```

**Negative pending** = User paid more than expected (shown in green)
**Positive pending** = User has outstanding payments (shown in yellow/orange)

#### Total Pending (Summary Tile)
```python
# Sum pending across all trackers
total_pending = sum(tracker.pending for tracker in all_trackers)
```
